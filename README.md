# Data Quality Analysis Project
A complete **Data Quality Assessment (DQA) project** built using Python in Google Colab. For the purposes of this project, the dataset I have used is that of a wholesale retailer.
This project showcases **data auditing, quality scoring, data cleansing, outlier detection**, and **report generation**. It also provides a copy of the clean dataset.

# Project Highlights

### End-to-End Data Quality Pipeline
- Missing value analysis  
- Duplicate detection  
- Type consistency checks  
- Outlier detection using IQR  

### Automated Reports
- **Professional HTML report**
- **Missing Values Report**
- **Top 10 missing column report**
- **Before vs After data quality comparison**


### Clean Dataset
You get a ready-to-use, cleaned version of the dataset.

# Data Quality Score
The project computes a unified DQ score using:
- Missing value penalties  
- Duplicate row penalties  
- Outlier penalties   
- Data type consistency  

A **Before vs After Cleaning** comparison is included.
