# Titanic Data Quality Analysis Project
A complete **Data Quality Assessment (DQA) project** built using Python, Google Colab, and the Titanic dataset.  
This project showcases **data auditing, quality scoring, data cleansing, business rule validation, outlier detection**, and **report generation** in both HTML and PDF formats.

# Project Highlights

### End-to-End Data Quality Pipeline
- Missing value analysis  
- Duplicate detection  
- Type consistency checks  
- Outlier detection using IQR  
- Data uniqueness metrics  
- Domain-specific business rule validation  

### Automated Reports
- **Professional HTML report**
- **PDF data quality summary**
- **Missing Values Report**
- **Heatmap of missingness**
- **Top 10 missing column report**
- **Before vs After data quality comparison**

### Clean Dataset
You get a ready-to-use, cleaned version of the Titanic dataset:
``results/cleaned_titanic.csv``.

# Data Quality Score
The project computes a unified DQ score using:
- Missing value penalties  
- Duplicate row penalties  
- Outlier penalties  
- Business rule violations  
- Data type consistency  

A **Before vs After Cleaning** comparison is included.
